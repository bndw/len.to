I tied in to an anchor a few hundred feet from the top as the
sun broke from behind. Slowly, rotating clockwise I peeled my chest from the wall while
carefully smearing the rubber of my heels across a sloping shelf below. 
As I pressed my back into the cold varnished stone a wave of brilliant morning light 
subsumed, what felt like at the time, the entire world.
