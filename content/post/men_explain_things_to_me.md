> The tyranny of the quantifiable is partly the failure of language and discourse
to describe more complex, subtle, and fluid phenomena, as well as the failure
of those who shape opinions and make decisions to understand and value these
slipperier things. It is difficult, sometimes even impossible, to value what
cannot be named or described, and so the task of naming and describing is an
essential one in any revolt against the status quo of capitalism and
consumerism. Ultimately the destruction of the earth is due in part, perhaps in
large part, to a failure of the imagination or to its eclipse by systems of
accounting that can’t count what matters. The revolt against this destruction
is a revolt of the imagination, in favor of subtleties, of pleasures money
can’t buy and corporations can’t command, of being producers rather than
consumers of meaning, of the slow, the meandering, the digressive, the
exploratory, the numinous, the uncertain.
