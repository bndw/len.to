[Flyboys](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/113665378/flyboys) is possibly the longest bolted 5.9
route in the United States.
<br>
<br>
We arrived in the valley around 10PM Friday night and continued up the
forest roads to the top of the 2,000ft Goat Wall to stash our mountain bikes in the trees.
We woke up at 4:30AM the next morning, fixed a quick breakfast and began the approach. 
The 18 pitch climb took about 6 hours and the ride off is definitely superior to rappeling through the crowds.
