> Ultimately the destruction of the earth is due in part, perhaps in
large part, to a failure of the imagination or to its eclipse by systems of
accounting that can’t count what matters. The revolt against this destruction
is a revolt of the imagination, in favor of subtleties, of pleasures money
can’t buy and corporations can’t command, of being producers rather than
consumers of meaning, of the slow, the meandering, the digressive, the
exploratory, the numinous, the uncertain.
