# Red Rock - Big Sky
[Big Sky](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106126784/big-sky) is 7 pitches and 1,000ft of 5.7 R trad climbing in the
First Creek Canyon area of Red Rock. Fish and I climbed this on 4/22/2019, swinging leads, and I found the climbing 
to be very secure through any run out sections, despite the R rating.
