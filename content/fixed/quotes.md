“ To the attentive eye, each moment of the year has its own beauty, and in the same field, it beholds, every hour, a picture which was never seen before, and which shall never be seen again. ”
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>- Ralph Waldo Emerson</span>


“ How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such
enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such a fabulous arabesque of
nerves as the brain can experience itself as anything less than a god? And, when
you consider that this incalculably subtle organism is inseparable from the
still more marvelous patterns of its environment- from the minutest electrical
designs to the whole company of the galaxies- how is it conceivable that this
incarnation of all eternity can be bored with being? ” 
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>- Allen Watts</span>

“ Peace can be made only by those who are peaceful, and love can be shown only by those who love. No work of love will flourish out of guilt, fear, or hollowness of heart, just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now. ” 
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>- Allen Watts</span>


“ The greatest miracle in the world is that you are, that I am. ”
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> -Osho</span>
