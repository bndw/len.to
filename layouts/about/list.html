              len.to is my opinionated take on a photo gallery.
              It's built using basic HTML and CSS, and includes some intentional JavaScript to enable additional features.
              It also works fine without JavaScript.
              It's compiled into a static site using <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a> and distributed as a Docker image.
              CSS and JavaScript are minified, and images are aggressively optimized and cached in a CDN.
              The result is a fast and efficient experience. At the time of writing this page is delivered in 18ms and weighs just 7 KiB.
